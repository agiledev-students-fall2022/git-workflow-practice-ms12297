All the facts listed on this page are interesting primarily because they are not well known. The facts that stood out to me most were:
- "Web Developer" is the most desired job title. I would have guessed people would like Full-Stack Developer or simply Software Engineer more but I guess not. 
- In the US, an average actively licensed physician is 52 years old while the average developer is just 32 years old. Hopefully, we are hired long before we turn 32. 
- While Software Engineers develop the most time learning, it is particularly those in the Gaming Industry that are the happiest. Hmmm.
